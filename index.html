    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Fort Worth Texas Roleplay. Please use the tabs above to navigate to different rules and information about our server.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="ingame" class="tab-content">
    <h2>In-Game Regulations</h2>
 <h3>Roblox Terms of Service</h3>
    <p>To roleplay here, you must adhere to <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Terms-of-Use" target="_blank">Roblox's Terms of Service</a>. Violating these terms may result in removal from the server.</p>

    <h3>1. Respect</h3>
    <p>Ensure you maintain a fundamental level of respect for your peers within the server. Regardless of your position, respect your peers at all times.</p>

    <h3>2. Random Deathmatch (RDM)</h3>
    <p>Random Deathmatch occurs when a player harms or kills others without justification. RDM disrupts realism and will result in warnings or disciplinary action.</p>

    <h3>3. Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)</h3>
    <p>Vehicle Deathmatch occurs when a player damages or kills others using a vehicle without valid roleplay context. This includes reckless driving or crashing without a scenario.</p>

    <h3>4. Fail Roleplay (FRP)</h3>
    <p>FailRP happens when a player acts unrealistically, such as jumping off buildings unharmed or using exploits. You must act as you would in real life.</p>

    <h3>5. New Life Rule (NLR)</h3>
    <p>After dying, your character forgets everything from the previous life. Do not return to the same scene, take revenge, or retain memory of what happened.</p>

    <h3>6. Unauthorized Organizations</h3>
    <p>Creating or roleplaying as unauthorized mafias, departments, or military groups is prohibited. Doing so may result in a ban without warning.</p>

    <h3>7. Character Conduct</h3>
    <p>Your character must simulate real human behavior, including fear, pain, and emotional responses. This adds realism and improves server quality.</p>

    <h3>8. Vehicular Conduct</h3>
    <p>Drive realistically. Account for traffic, obey traffic laws, and adjust speed for weather or RP context. Reckless or GTA-style driving is not allowed.</p>

    <h3>9. Banned Roleplays</h3>
    <p>Roleplays that violate Roblox ToS are not allowed. This includes erotic RP, terrorism, suicide, or bomb threats. Keep roleplays safe and appropriate.</p>

    <h3>10. Safezones</h3>
    <p>Safezones are no-conflict areas such as spawns and Staff HQ. Roleplay can start there but cannot be forcefully initiated without RP context.</p>

    <h3>11. Common Sense</h3>
    <p>If it feels wrong or unrealistic, donâ€™t do it. Use common sense in situations not covered by specific rules. This is a realistic roleplay server.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="discord" class="tab-content">

    <p>Only ping others when necessary. Do not ping @Management Team or higher without permission.</p>

    <h3>3. Language</h3>
    <p>Use respectful, appropriate language. Avoid explicit, offensive, or harmful language.</p>

    <h3>4. Common Sense</h3>
    <p>Think before you post. Contribute positively and avoid actions that would obviously be disruptive.</p>

    <h3>5. Content</h3>
    <p>Keep discussions in the correct channels. Avoid spam, off-topic posts, or content that doesnâ€™t follow the theme of the channel.</p>

    <h3>6. Advertising</h3>
    <p>Do not advertise other communities or products without prior approval. Even approved promotions should be short and relevant.</p>

    <h3>7. Terms and Guidelines</h3>
    <p>Follow <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Discord's Terms of Service</a> and Community Guidelines. Donâ€™t share private information or break platform rules.</p>

    <h3>8. Bots</h3>
    <p>Use bots properly and only for their intended purpose. Do not abuse commands or cause spam.</p>

    <h3>9. Feedback</h3>
    <p>Use the <strong>ðŸ“© suggestions</strong> channel to share feedback respectfully. Constructive ideas are welcomed; negativity is not.</p>

    <h3>10. Civility in Debates</h3>
    <p>You can disagree, but stay respectful. Arguments, name-calling, or provoking others will not be tolerated.</p>

    <h3>11. Multiple Accounts</h3>
    <p>Only one account per user is allowed in the server. Alternate or backup accounts are not permitted.</p>

    <h3>12. Reporting Issues</h3>
